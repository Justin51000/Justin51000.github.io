# Attend & Review a Workshop at Penn
December 8, 2024

I attended the Python for Humanists workshop offered through Penn Libraries, originally scheduled for November 8th but postponed until November 22nd. The workshop was run by Cynthia Heider and Dr. Lynda Kellam, and it was nice to be able to catch up with Dr. Kellam as she had previously advised me with my thesis work. The workshop itself was designed for absolute beginners in Python, and I was coming into it with quite a bit of experience. I had previously taken a course on introductory Python for data science in the Computer Science Department, and my thesis required me to learn a lot as I was manipulating huge amounts of data and files. Although I was coming in with quite a bit of experience using Python for the humanities, I thought the workshop was put together very thoughtfully.
We began by looking at the resources offered by Penn Libraries to do coding in a virtual environment through GitHub. We ran over the most basic concepts of assigning values, functions, and data types. The introduction took most of the workshop, and we had a good time making jokes through assigning our variables funny names and adding them together. The last part of the workshop was thinking about humanizing data and employing Python in humanistic studies. We discussed a few examples like managing files, doing text analysis, and doing OCR. 
I didn’t learn new skills from the workshop since I already had experience with Python, but it connected well to themes from our class and solidified the place Python has in humanistic projects in my mind. Python is a powerful tool for both qualitative and quantitative research in the humanities. It can automate repetitive tasks like organizing and renaming large sets of files, which I’ve used to make my historical article archive consistent and easier to work with. For example, using Python to systematically rename and organize over 2,200 scanned articles allowed me to locate and analyze materials more efficiently, which was essential for my thesis. 
Python also facilitates text processing. I used Tesseract OCR with Python to transform scanned articles into searchable text, making it possible to identify keywords for close reading and perform computational analyses of overarching themes, topics, and sentiment. These analyses relied on Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, which helped me structure and manipulate the data. With these tools, I could aggregate and compare patterns across the dataset, revealing trends that weren’t immediately apparent, like shifts in discourse over time or changes in topic prevalence. Python supports all sorts of computational analyzes on datasets. For example, I was interested in making a causal argument on the sentiment on a certain topic which was facilitated by running regression models on Python. By using Python for both close reading and computational analysis, I could take a more comprehensive approach to the dataset. This balance allowed me to connect detailed observations about individual texts to broader patterns and trends across the collection, making it possible to explore both specific and large-scale questions in my research.
In addition to analysis, Python is a useful tool for visualizing data. Libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly make it easy to create clear, informative visualizations such as bar graphs, line plots, and maps—all of which I have used extensively in my research. I used these tools to depict trends and patterns in my manually coded data, which helped me better understand changes over time and across different contexts. These visualizations were not just useful for analysis, they also helped me present my findings in a way that was accessible and interpretable for audiences, whether they were experts or general readers. In this way, Python has been useful at every step of projects I have worked on, and it seems to be an exceptionally useful tool in every aspect of humanistic research.
