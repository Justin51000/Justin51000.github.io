# Looking Forward

I plan to use many of the methodological, ethical, and technical skills we’ve covered in class in the near future. These skills will guide specific projects I am currently developing and influence how I approach digital content as a scholar.

1. **Mock Online Museum Exhibit**  
   I will use a GitHub website to create a mock online museum exhibit that includes an essay and five images of objects. The essay focuses on Christian material culture and examines the tension between didacticism and iconoclasm in the 6th to 8th centuries. The objects serve as examples to explore these themes. The online format challenges me to consider how these objects are presented visually. As 2-dimensional images, they cannot fully represent the 3-dimensional experiences of the objects as they were encountered in their original contexts. This project requires thinking critically about how digital platforms can both enhance and limit the interpretation of material culture, a methodological and ethical issue central to our class discussions.

2. **Expanding the Black Press Website**  
   I will update and expand my website on the Black press’s views of Confederate commemoration. One addition will be a data exploration page featuring graphs, tables, and statistics to help users engage with the dataset. Another addition will be a new page that adapts my sociology senior honors thesis into a format suitable for online reading, complete with images and graphs integrated into the narrative. These updates will require careful attention to how I present the data and conclusions, ensuring transparency and accessibility while staying true to the historical context. Both the data exploration page and the adapted thesis will draw heavily on the methodological, technical, and ethical considerations we explored in class.

3. **Critical Engagement with Digital Archives and Exhibits in Future Research**  
   As a scholar, I frequently encounter digital archives, museum exhibits, and similar platforms. This class has given me tools to critically assess how such content is constructed and presented. I will use these skills to evaluate the choices made in the design, accessibility, and framing of digital spaces. Whether through formal research or informal analysis, I will consider how these platforms influence public understanding of the materials they present. This critical lens will guide my future engagement with digital content, both as a creator and a user.
