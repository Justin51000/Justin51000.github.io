As I write this in Decemeber of 2024, I am a senior at the University of Pennsylvania majoring in sociology and minoring in religious studies. I intend to attend seminary for ordination within the United Methodist Church, followed by PhD studies in sociology. My research interests are primarily in the sociology of knowledge and belief, especially in the realm of collective memory. I have worked in Digital Humanities for three years on my project called *"False Image of History": Perspectives on Confederate Commemoration from the Black Press* which has documented Black views on Confederate commemorations throughout American history.
